## Importance of matches
When a player turns 18, [[Game Time]] is more important than [[Training]]
Players need to produce good match ratings *and win games* to develop effectively

- #### Use Reserves/U23s
	- Ensure the stiffs have a decent starting 11 and 13-17 players, **players need to win games and get good ratings** to improve effectively.
	- Exclude the bad youth players who won't contribute to winning games and getting good match ratings.

- #### Use the [[Loan]] system
	-  Try to loan youngsters to teams in high reputation leagues, and better _[[training facilities]]_, NOT [[youth facilities]].
	- Negotiate loan agreements to maximise playing time and specific positions, you want as many GOOD MATCH RATINGS & WINS as possible

## Mentoring and Group Placement
- Mentoring groups with older/[[influential]] players can improve [[hidden stats]], [[Personalities]] and [[MHS]].
- Use spare registration spots for experiences players with high reputation and good [[Personalities]].

## Training Regime for Young Players
- Avoid adding player traits until after they turn 18. Stats develop much quicker between 15-16, trait develop is consistent (or improves as mental stats/personality does). So learning traits early will waste prime attribute development years.
